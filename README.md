# Jude Avery  
### Data Scientist | University of Texas at Dallas (B.S. Data Science)

I'm a data science graduate from the University of Texas at Dallas with a strong interest in using data to understand behavior, build predictive models, and turn messy datasets into clear insights. I enjoy working on end-to-end projects that involve data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and interpretation.

Most of my work lives at the intersection of **sports analytics**, **machine learning**, and **applied data analysis**, with a focus on projects that mirror real-world problems rather than classroom exercises.
